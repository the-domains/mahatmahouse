## Welcome to Mahatma House

This sleek and sophisticated five-bedroom villa on Bali's south-west coast is the epitome of cool, featuring polished black surfaces, meticulous symmetrical lines and a stunning array of Asian antiquities.

Privately enclosed within a spacious walled garden abundant with palm trees and tropical plants, the bedrooms and living areas of Mahatma House are arranged around a sparkling 18-metre river-stone swimming pool, which forms the centerpiece to this luxurious villa, all just a minutes walk from the charming traditional Balinese village of Seseh and its rugged surf beach.
