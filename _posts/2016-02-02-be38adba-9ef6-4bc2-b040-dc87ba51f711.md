## About Mahatma House

Super sleek and sexy, but fabulously comfortable, Mahatma House would not be out of place in one of the world's fashion capitals, yet this impressive five-bedroom villa is located in the beautiful and very traditional Balinese village of Seseh, just a stone's throw from the beach.

Mahatma House is owned by a Spanish model and a fashion designer and their sense of style and sophistication shines throughout the villa, from the fabulous black interiors to the incredible array of Asian antiquities.

There are seemingly endless opportunities for relaxation at Mahatma House: recline under a parasol on a daybed fit for royalty; sip sunset cocktails on the party-size sofas by the pool; chill out in the comfortable garden balé with friends, or simply take a moment to rest and rejuvenate in peace on your private bedroom balcony.

With its enormous kitchen and dining space and its open-sided living areas looking out across the magnificent tropical gardens and swimming pool, Mahatma House is an ideal venue for social events, whether it be a wedding, milestone celebration or informal and relaxed get-together with friends or family. And the impeccably trained staff, including an experienced villa manager and restaurant-trained private chef, will ensure that every moment of your stay is absolutely faultless.

Only a few metres from the villa lies Seseh's glistening volcanic-sand beach, where surf beckons and rock pools fascinate. Watch the local fisherman haul in their daily catch, and the village children play football at dusk. Or wander to the local temple where enchanting ceremonies are performed daily against the ocean backdrop. For adventure further afield, hire Mahatma's car and driver; within twenty minutes you could be dining at one of Seminyak's world class restaurants, shopping at a très chic boutique, or teeing off on the world renowned Nirwana Bali Golf course.
